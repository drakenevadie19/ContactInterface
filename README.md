# ContactInterface
Guided by Mr. Emmanuel Henri in the course Building Full-Stack Apps with React and Spring from Linkedin Learning, I created a simple interface, using React combined with Materialize CSS for adding new contact to Phone list, fetching data from server and displaying them. I also create a server, using Spring Boot to manage information.
